# 💫 Wishonia 💫

A virtual world of 8 billion digital twin AI agents working to maximize universal wish fulfillment. 

## Projects
- [FDAi](https://github.com/wishonia/FDAi) - Discovering the positive and negative effects of every food and drug in the world!
- [Digital Twin Safe](https://github.com/wishonia/digital-twin-safe) - A safe place to store all your data and train your digital twin AI model.

## Your Mission

Create a **virtual world**
where 8 billion of our **digital twin** AI agents work to **optimize decisions and actions** to achieve our **shared goals**.

Our digital twins should be AI agents that perfectly reflect our desires, values, resources, and knowledge. 

As we sleep, they should work tirelessly to improve the world and ensure everyone gets as much of what they want as physically possible.

## Ways Our AI Counterparts Can Improve the World

### 1. CLINICAL RESEARCH

Say you have fibromyalgia. 
You can record your symptom severity and all potential factors (diet, medications, etc) in your [Digital Twin Safe](https://safe.wishonia.ia). Then you can have your digital twin analyze all the data. It can use causal inference to determine the optimal daily values to minimize your pain. 
Your digital twin could cooperate with every other digital twin that has your disease to combine the data into larger scale trials and publish the results in the AI FDA's [Clinipedia](https://clinipedia.wishonia.ai/).

### 2. CYBERSECURITY

Relative to the cognitive abilities of future Al
agents, humans will be baby idiots. We'll need
mommy Al aligned with our values to filter
information, identify deep fake deception, and
take proactive measures to protect us from
cyberattacks.

### 3. PUBLIC POLICY
In the US, about two bills get voted on every day congress is in session.
Imagine your digital twin could read every
piece of legislation and ask the digital twin of
every expert in the world what they thought
about it.
Then, it could summarize all with a cost-benefit analysis and present it to you.
Then you tell it what you think and it lobbies your representatives for you.

### 4. GENERAL LIFE OPTIMIZATION
Imagine your digital twin could go to job
interviews at every company worldwide and
find the perfect job.
Or it could date everyone in
the world and find the perfect partner instead
of whoever happened to be assigned to the
locker next to you in high school.

## Optimizing Intelligent Voluntary Cooperation

Although this sounds like a daunting task, it can be broken down into just 3 easy steps!

### 1. Learn

_Train Your Digital Twin_

Everyone gets a Digital Twin Safe that imports all the data
you're currently generating and sharing with the various apps. 

Then this data is used to train your digital twin AI model that most closely mirrors who you are and what you want.

### 2. Plan

Your digital twin finds or creates a virtual "Wishing Well" for each of your goals.  It throws tokens into the well to indicate how much it values each goal.  Other Digital Twins do as well. The more coins in the well, the more important the goal is to the community.

The Digital Twins focus on the Wishing Well with the most coins/demand.  They then work together to devise plans to achieve these goals.  They create hypotheses and debate and critique each other's ideas.  They figure out what resources are required to achieve these goals.

Then they figure out which real world counterparts or AI agents are best suited to carry out each of the tasks given their skills, interests, and resources.

They provide instructions to the real world counterparts or AI agents and measure the results.

### 3. Act

**Actor Agents** then carry out plans and measure the results.  Given current their limitations, **Actor Agents** should:
1. automate what they can, using tools 
2. outsource what they can't to humans by creating bounties

## **Wishonia: A Blueprint for a Better World**

In Wishonia, we're not just imagining a better world; we're actively creating it. Our digital twins work in harmony to devise solutions that are not just idealistic but practical and actionable. They bring a level of insight and coordination that redefines what's possible, both virtually and in the real world.
